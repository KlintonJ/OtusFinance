  In this application, you will arrive at the landing page upon opening it. On the landing page there are two buttons that allow the user to login or signup, if the user is new 
to the application. If the user is new to the app and clicks the signup button, it will take the user to the signup page where the user must enter a username, password, and 
re-type password. Once the user is finished they will click the signup button, which will take the user to the login page to login to the application. On both the login and 
signup is a home button that would take the user back to the landing page if user clicked either by mistake. So once the user is logged in, they will be taken to the 
dashboard, which is a summary of the transaction history and monthly cap for that month. Using the tab bar on the right side of application, the user can next go to the 
reports page, which will have all transactions recorded by the user through an entry box that allow the user to enter the amount spent, what they bought, and when they bought 
it. Once the user presses "log expense" it will display the transaction in the transaction history of the page. The next page is the settings page which allows the user to change 
their password, log out, and set a monthly cap. The last page the user can go to is the Overview page. In this page the user can see an overview 
of their spending habits and the top categories they spent the most money in.
